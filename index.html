        You had this same radio with you back in college, and would sometimes leave it on with its volume turned down, like you have now. You remember one time you had it playing before you went to Thompson's party. Isla was at the party too, though you hadn't known her name at that time.<br>

      <div class="dialog" id="radio-listen-party">
        When you went outside there were a few stragglers sitting outside, some who were disinterested in the party or otherwise felt a little socially overwhelmed. There was a swarm of fireflies outside in Thompson's yard. Isla was sitting on his porch, brooding, and you showed her how to catch fireflies with your cupped hands, just like how your father taught you. You caught three and put them in her empty glass.<br>
        She had laughed and said "Oh," in a quiet monotone, cracked from not speaking for so long, and then, correcting herself, said "oh" again, but had this time tried earnestly to sound more impressed, more fascinated.<br>

        Thompson liked to paint what he called "plein airs." Once, you helped carry his easel as the two of you climbed over construction barriers to the part of the river where the dead fish lay beached on the sand.<br>
        He had tried to teach you how to paint but you ended up falling asleep. "Just use gentle criss-cross strokes for the sky," he had said. "Gentle, criss-cross strokes."<br>

        You remember the time you went back home from college to your dying father: you had stepped outside for a moment, and gazed at the shoats, shivering in the night air because no one had brought them back in. "A stroke," the doctors had said, your father had had a stroke. In his last days your father had grown hateful and afraid: afraid of immobility, afraid of death, afraid that he would one day no longer understand (though this had already happened, and it was only delusion that made him believe that this was not so) the world.<br>

      <div class="dialog" id="radio-listen-horses2">
        Across the fields (now fallow and unfarmed in your father's old age) you witnessed a herd of wild horses file across parallel to the old fence which kept the shoats away from the outside world. Or maybe you imagined it: that evening you had done (in secret) a small amount of psilocybin in order to bear your father's ravings (even more hateful and uninformed than usual, and a little too much to bear, not that you had all that many opinions about anything - the general consensus among your peers was that you weren't the sharpest tool in the shed).<br>
        When your father died later that night it was a relief, and you brought the shoats in and slept in the barn.<br>

        On the train back to the college - and this would be the last time you went back to the college, with your father dying penniless followed by the foreclosure indicating that you had best be moving on (you hadn't felt much anything about this, it just seemed like what had to be done, one of many things that happened to a person) - you had stared out the window and wondered about where the horses had come from and where they were going. Though you hadn't realized it at the time, you would soon be like the wild horses: always going places, full of spirit, living, and what the hills were made of, always moving. Movement.<br>
